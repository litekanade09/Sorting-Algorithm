This section delves into fundamental sorting algorithms implemented in Java, focusing on their mechanisms, efficiencies, and practical applications.

Introduction to Sorting: Explained the importance of sorting in data organization and retrieval, and how it enhances algorithm efficiency.

Bubble Sort: Implemented the bubble sort algorithm, illustrating its simple approach and time complexity of O(n²) in the worst case.

Selection Sort: Covered selection sort, demonstrating how it repeatedly selects the minimum element and places it in the sorted portion, with a time complexity of O(n²).

Insertion Sort: Implemented insertion sort, showing its effectiveness for small datasets and its O(n²) average case performance.

Comparison of Algorithms: Analyzed the strengths and weaknesses of each sorting method, highlighting when to use each algorithm based on data characteristics.
